# Private ERC-20 Token Creation Project

This project demonstrates how to create and deploy a simple ERC20 (fungible token) smart contract using Hardhat, a popular Solidity development framework. The project is deployed on the Swisstronik network.

## Overview

The ERC20 standard is widely used for creating fungible digital assets (tokens). This project sets up a basic ERC20 token with customizable parameters and deployment scripts. You can use this as a starting point for creating your own tokens or expanding the functionality to suit more complex use cases.

## Features

- ERC20 Standard: Implements the ERC20 standard with minting and transfer functionality.
- Custom Token Parameters: Supports setting token name, symbol, and initial supply.
- Deployment: Scripts for deploying the contract to the Swisstronik network.
- Testing: Basic tests for the ERC20 functionality using Hardhat.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js: Ensure you have Node.js installed (>= 14.x).
- npm or yarn: Package manager for installing dependencies.
- Hardhat: A development environment for Ethereum smart contracts.
- Swisstronik Network: Access to the Swisstronik network for deployment.

## Getting Started

Here is the main guide: https://swisstronik.gitbook.io/swisstronik-docs/development/guides/contract-deployment-hardhat/

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Leihyn/swissERC20.git
cd erc20-token-swisstronik
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

### 3. Configure the network

In the `hardhat.config.js` file, configure the Swisstronik network settings:

USE A DEMO ACCOUNT; an account you can afford to lose**

```javascript
module.exports = {
  solidity: "0.8.19",
  networks: {
    swisstronik: {
      url: "(use swisstronik rpc)",  // Replace with the correct RPC URL in the gitbook
      accounts: ["YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY"],  // Replace with your Swisstronik network private key
    },
  },
};
```

### 4. Compile the contract

```bash
npx hardhat compile
```

### 5. Deploy the contract

```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network swisstronik
```

### 6. Run tests

```bash
npx hardhat test
```

## Project Structure

- contracts/: Contains the ERC20 smart contract.
- scripts/: Deployment scripts.
- test/: Test files for the ERC20 contract.
- hardhat.config.js: Hardhat configuration file.

## Customization

- Token Name, Symbol, and Supply: Modify the name, symbol, and initial supply of the token in the ERC20 contract.

## Deployment

After configuring the network and writing your contract, you can deploy it using the deployment script. The script will push the contract to the Swisstronik network, and you'll receive a contract address upon success.
